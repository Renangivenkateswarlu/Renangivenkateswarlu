Here’s a detailed breakdown for both options to achieve your objectives:

Option 1: Robot Fleet Monitoring Dashboard

1. Features

Frontend Requirements 
Dashboard Components:
  Robot List: Table/List to show robot details (ID, status, battery %, CPU usage, etc.)
    Map View: Use Leaflet.js or Mapbox to display robot positions.
    Highlighting: 
    Mark offline robots in red.  
      Highlight low battery robots (<20%) in yellow.  
    Filters:
    By status: Active, Offline, Low Battery.
  
  Real-Time Updates: 
  Poll backend every 5 seconds or use WebSockets for instant updates.

 Backend Requirements 
 Mock Data Generation:  
  Generate telemetry data (battery, CPU usage, etc.) for up to 10 robots using Python. Example `robot_data.json` format:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "robot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        "status": true,
        "battery": 76,
        "cpu": 55,
        "ram": 70,
        "last_updated": "2024-12-12T12:34:56",
        "location": [12.971598, 77.594566]
      }
    ]
    ```
- API Endpoints:
  `GET /robots`: Fetch all robot details.
    `WS /robots/updates`: Send real-time telemetry updates (WebSocket).

Additional:
Containerize with Docker for easy deployment.

2. Steps to Build

Backend (FastAPI/Flask)
1. Simulate Robot Data:
   Write a Python script to generate mock robot telemetry.
     Update data periodically (every 5s) in-memory or via a database like SQLite.

2. API Implementation:
    Use REST for initial data fetching and WebSocket for live updates.
3. Expose APIs:
    `GET /robots`: Fetch robot data.
     `WS /robots/updates`: Stream data to clients.

Frontend (React.js)
1. Dashboard Design:
   Use a React table for robot list.
     Integrate Mapbox/Leaflet.js for location mapping.

2. Real-Time Data:
    Fetch initial data from `GET /robots`.
     Subscribe to WebSocket for live updates.
3. Highlighting & Filters:
   Conditional styling for low battery and offline robots.
     Filters for robot status.
Hosting:
1. Frontend: Deploy React app on Netlify.
2. Backend: Deploy FastAPI/Flask on Heroku or Render.
Bonus Features:
 Add a filter dropdown.
 Containerize backend/frontend with Docker Compose
Option 2: ROS Log Viewer and Analyzer
1. Features
Frontend Requirements 
 Log Table
   Parse and display logs with columns:
     Timestamp
      Severity
      Node Name
     Message Content
     Filters:
     Filter logs by severity (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
     Search:
    Search bar to find specific keywords.
    Highlighting:
     Color-code severity: WARN (yellow), ERROR (red).
  Download Feature: 
   Enable filtered logs download as a new file.
 Backend Requirements 
  Log Parsing:
  Parse uploaded `.log` or `.txt` files to extract key details.
    Example log entry:
  
     [2024-12-12 12:34:56] [ERROR] [NodeX]: Message content
     
API Endpoints:
   `POST /logs/upload`: Accept file uploads.
    `GET /logs`: Fetch parsed log data.

Additional:
Containerize with Docker
2. Steps to Build
Backend (FastAPI/Flask)
1. Log Parser:
    Use Python’s `re` library to extract log details (timestamp, severity, etc.).
     Store parsed data in memory or a temporary database.

2. API Implementation:
    `POST /logs/upload`: Accept and parse uploaded files.
     `GET/logs`: Serve parsed log data (with optional query params for filters).

Frontend (React.js)
1. Log Viewer Design:
    Use a React table (e.g., Material-UI or Ant Design) for displaying logs.
    Add severity filters (dropdown) and search bar.

2. API Integration:
   Upload logs via `POST /logs/upload`.
     Fetch filtered logs using `GET /logs`

3. Highlighting:
    Conditional styling for WARN (yellow) and ERROR (red) entries.

Hosting:
1. Frontend: Deploy React app on Netlify
2. Backend: Deploy FastAPI/Flask on Heroku or Render.

Bonus Features
Allow downloading filtered logs
   Add Docker support
 Suggested Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Material-UI/Ant Design, Leaflet.js (for maps).  
Backend: FastAPI (preferred), SQLite (optional for persistence).  
Hosting: Netlify (frontend), Heroku/Render (backend).  
Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose.
